# idaifieldR 0.1.0 _2021-03-03_

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
* Basic functions work but are not thoroughly tested

# idaifieldR 0.1.1 _2021-04-13_

First release. 

I will try to limit future changes so that they will not affect the structural outcome of the core functions as they are now. 

TODOs:
* Find a way to handle the remaining lists better, esp in combination with the non-list columns.
* Try to assign column type automatically (numeric for numbers etc.)
* How to deal with the dimension...-fields (measurements)? Currently ignored, can be flattened with dplyr and friends.
