Description: idaifieldR imports data from the iDAI.field 2 / Field Desktop
    database into R. The core functions of this package use sofa
    (available on CRAN) to connect to a syncing iDAI.field 2 or Field
    Desktop client and store the whole database in a list in R (in
    memory), avoiding the csv-export that would otherwise be needed and
    gathering all documents at once, which is not possible with said
    csv-export. Any R-Script using idaifieldR to import the database can
    be re-run and updated with new data flexibly without exporting from
    the iDAI.field 2 or Field Desktop Client itself.
