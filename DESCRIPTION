Title: Importing Data from iDAI.field 2 into R
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Lisa Steinmann
Maintainer: Lisa Steinmann <lisa.steinmann@rub.de>
Description: idaifieldR imports data from the iDAI.field 2
    database into R.  The core functions of this package use sofa
    (available on CRAN) to connect to a syncing iDAI.field 2-client and
    store the whole database in a list in R (in memory), avoiding the
    csv-export that would otherwise be needed and gathering all documents
    at once, which is not possible with said csv-export.  Any R-Script
    using idaifieldR to import the database can be re-run and updated with
    new data flexibly without exporting from the iDAI.field 2-Client
    itself.
