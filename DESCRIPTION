Description: idaifieldR imports data from the iDAI.field / Field Desktop
    database into R. The core functions of this package use the API of 
    CouchDB to query a syncing Field Desktop client and store the whole 
    database or a subset in a list in R (in memory), avoiding the csv-export. 
    The package offers functions to simplify and reformat that data somewhat. 
    Any R-Script using idaifieldR to import the database can be re-run and 
    updated with new data flexibly without exporting from the Client itself.
