<!-- badges: start -->

The goal of idaifieldR is to ... get data from idaifield (https://github.com/dainst/idai-field) into R. 
This is currently not usable. 

I want to: 
* make it easy to access the data from idaifield2 for myself and potentially others
* get to a point where tables can be imported flexibly into R

(this currently works easiest with csv-import, but it can be easier)


## Dependencies

This depends on the r-package `sofa` (https://github.com/ropensci/sofa).

## Installation

You can install the released version of idaifieldR from ....
But you should not install it right now, because it can't really do anything yet.

``` r
devtools::install.github("lsteinmann/idaifieldR")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(idaifieldR)
## basic example code
```
