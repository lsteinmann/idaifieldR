<!-- badges: start -->

The goal of idaifieldR is to ... get data from idaifield (https://github.com/dainst/idai-field) into R. 
This is currently not very usable and an absolutely raw draft. What I want to do is: 
* make it easy to access the data from idaifield2 for myself and potentially others
* get to a point where tables can be imported flexibly into R

(this currently works easiest with csv-import, but it can be easier)

(It already works, sort of, but is not documented well. I am trying to keep this flexible so that it will not depend on the configuration.)

I would also very much like to make it somewhat accesible to people not very (but somewhat) familiar with R.

## Dependencies

This depends on the r-package `sofa` (https://github.com/ropensci/sofa).

## Installation

You can install the released version of idaifieldR from ....
But you should not install it right now unless you know what you are doing and want to help me make this usable (or even good).

``` r
devtools::install.github("lsteinmann/idaifieldR")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(idaifieldR)
## basic example code
```
